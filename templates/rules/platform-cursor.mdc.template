# Cursor-Specific Rules

## Platform Detection

This project is configured for **Cursor IDE**. Rules are automatically applied when Cursor is detected.

## Cursor Integration

- Rules files are located in `.cursor/rules/`
- Multiple rule files (`.mdc`) are supported
- Cursor automatically reads rules from `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`

## Workflow Integration

- Use `adbs` commands for workflow management (shorter alias for `workflow-enforcer`)
- SDD artifacts are stored in `.sdd/` directory structure
- Plan-based workflow with incremental plan IDs

## Best Practices for Cursor

1. **Use Cursor's AI features** in conjunction with SDD workflow
2. **Reference plan IDs** when discussing requirements, design, or tasks
3. **Update task status** as you work through implementation
4. **Follow stage validation** before proceeding to next stage
