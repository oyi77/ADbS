# Gemini-Specific Rules

## Platform Detection

This project is configured for **Gemini AI**. Rules are automatically applied when Gemini is detected.

## Gemini Integration

- Rules files are located in `.gemini/rules/`
- Multiple rule files (`.mdc`) are supported
- Gemini automatically reads rules from `.gemini/rules/*.mdc`

## Workflow Integration

- Use `adbs` commands for workflow management (shorter alias for `workflow-enforcer`)
- SDD artifacts are stored in `.sdd/` directory structure
- Plan-based workflow with incremental plan IDs

## Best Practices for Gemini

1. **Use Gemini's AI features** in conjunction with SDD workflow
2. **Reference plan IDs** when discussing requirements, design, or tasks
3. **Update task status** as you work through implementation
4. **Follow stage validation** before proceeding to next stage
