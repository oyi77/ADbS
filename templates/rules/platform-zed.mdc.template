# Zed-Specific Rules

## Context

- This project uses the ADbS workflow.
- Zed reads rules from `.rules` at the project root.
- The `adbs` tool manages this file by concatenating rules.

## Capabilities

- Zed does not support complex frontmatter in `.rules`, but we include it for compatibility.
- Use `adbs` for all workflow tasks.
